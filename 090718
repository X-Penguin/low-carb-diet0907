Low carbohydrate diets have been linked to reduced longevity – except for when dieters ditch the steak for plant-based alternatives.
低碳水化合物饮食一直与寿命减少有关——除了节食者放弃牛排选择植物型替代食物的情况外。

An analysis of data from 15,400 people in the US has found a U-shaped relationship between mortality and carbohydrate intake. The study found that the people who lived longest tended to be those who got around 50 to 55 per cent of their energy intake from carbohydrates. At the age of 50, such people could expect to live a further 33 years.
美国的一项基于15400人的研究发现了死亡率与碳水化合物摄入量之间的U型关系。该研究发现，碳水化合物摄入量占能量摄入的50-55%的人往往最长寿。在五十岁时，该人群预期可以多活33年。

This is one year longer than people who get 70 per cent or more of their energy from carbs, and four years longer than people get less than 30 per cent of their calories from carbohydrates.
这比碳水化合物摄入量占能量摄入的70%以上的人群多一年，比占30%以下的人多四年。

Sara Seidelmann, at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, and her colleagues wondered if the types of fat and protein people eat on low-carb diets might contribute to reduced longevity.
波士顿布莱根妇女医院（Brigham and Women’s Hospital）的萨拉·塞德曼（Sara Seidelmann）以及她的同事想知道低碳水化合物饮食中的脂类和蛋白质是否导致了寿命缩短。

Diving into the data, they found that when people replaced carbs with meat such as lamb, pork, beef and chicken – typical for low carb dieters in Europe and the US — their mortality increased.
在数据中深入研究后，她们发现当人们将碳水化合物替换为例如牛羊猪鸡肉的肉类——欧洲和美国的低碳水化合物饮食者的典型风格——时，他们的死亡率上升了。

Plant proteins
植物蛋白

But the opposite was true for those who instead ate plant-based sources of protein and fat such as legumes, vegetables and nuts. “The more you exchange plant-based fats and proteins for carbohydrates, the more the risk lowers,” says Seidelmann.
但是对于将碳水化合物替换为例如豆类、蔬菜和坚果一类的植物性的蛋白质和脂肪的人来说，事实恰恰相反。“植物性脂肪和蛋白质替换的碳水化合物越多，风险越小。”萨拉·塞德曼如是说。

The team think that the increased mortality of a low carb, high meat diet is due to lower intake of fruit and vegetables, and the harmful effects of animal proteins and fats on the body’s inflammation and oxidative stress systems.
其团队认为，低碳水化合物高脂肪饮食的死亡率增长是由于蔬菜水果的摄入量减少，以及动物蛋白和脂肪对身体炎症和氧化应激系统【1】的有害影响。

“If you are going to choose a very low carbohydrate diet as a way to lose weight or as an eating pattern, it’s very important that you are mindful to replace carbohydrate with more plant-based food,” says Seidelmann.
“如果您打算选择极低碳水化合物饮食作为减肥方法或饮食方式，那么注意用更加植物性的食物来代替碳水化合物是很重要的。”萨拉·塞德曼如是说。 

As for those who eat a lot of carbs, their death rates may be higher due to metabolic problems associated with eating large amounts of refined carbohydrates, such as white rice and bread.
对于那些摄入大量碳水化合物的人，因为与摄入大量例如白米饭和面包的精制碳水化合物有关的新陈代谢问题，他们的死亡率可能会更高一些。
